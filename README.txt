Please ignore the average row length and the row length as they are inaccurate. Instead in the repository, inside insertion_images, find the associated tables and their population after the SQL script provided is run. Please do pardon the lack of editing but the tables are present, You will also find the primary keys and the foreign keys listed, in the bottom left.

The repository also includes the Milestone 2 ER diagram, as well as the one used for implementing M4.

We still satisfy the initial requirements for the ER diagram, and yes there is an aggregation present. 

Please note that there was a typographical error for Membership Entity: this is not a weak entity any more.

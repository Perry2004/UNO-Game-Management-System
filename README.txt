Please ignore the average row length and the row length as they are inaccurate. Instead in the repository, inside insertion_images, find the associated tables and their population after the SQL script provided is run. Please do pardon the lack of editing but the tables are present, You will also find the primary keys and the foreign keys listed, in the bottom left. Pardon the lack of convention but we were told that we could use a generator: the how of the generator i.e. how to interpret the schema, is inside the M4 doc.

The repository also includes the Milestone 2 ER diagram, as well as the one used for implementing M4.

We still satisfy the initial requirements for the ER diagram, and yes there is an aggregation present. 

PLEASE note that there was a typographical error for Membership Entity: this is not a weak entity any more: SO IT HAS A PRIMARY KEY i.e. there is a straight line NOT a dotted line; we lost the original we used to create it.

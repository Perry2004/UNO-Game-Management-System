# UNO GAME SYSTEM MANAGER AND USER  

The Game State Management encompasses the entire game state of an
Uno Game. For example, the cards held by each player, the type of cards
held by each player, the cards remaining in the deck. and whose turn it is.
A real-life situation would of course be a group of individuals engaged in
a (virtual) game of Uno.This addresses the issue of tracking game states.
For “Logistics for Game App Users’ information,” we keep track of
virtual items that players have linked to their accounts e.g. badges, avatars,
and virtual characters. We also track player transactions using Stores, and 
we allow Players to participate in "LuckyDraws" which grant them items on 
a sporadic basis. 
A real-life situation to which this can be
assimilated, is an online platform for a card game where players have
accounts with virtual characters that represent them inside the game, and
have items (badges etc.) linked to their account. This addresses the issue
of account management. Furthermore, this database could also be
modified briefly to apply in any online card game environment such as
“Exploding Kittens”.

We divided the backend (specificaly the database tables (relations)) such that all 3 of us have equivalent effort put in. <br>
For the frontend, we divide the tasks in a similar manner so all members have equal contribution to the final Product. <br>
